10. If needed install Eclipse-CDT <- only needed if we are debugging c++ code 
    - sudo apt-get install eclipse-cdt
	- Restart the Odroid
	
11. This link shows the required steps to configure the FlyCapture drivers for an ARM processor
	http://www.ptgrey.com/KB/10357
	- Download the latest FlyCapture drivers for the Odroid Located in the Box folder
	- Unzip to the Odroid home folder
	- In a terminal type the following to copy all libraries to system folders:
		cd flycapture-<version>_arm/lib
		sudo cp libflycapture* /usr/lib
		cd flycapture-<version>_arm/
	- Configure permissions to run Point Grey cameras:
		sudo sh flycap2-conf
		- Enter odroid for the username
		- press y for each questions
	- Follow the instructions of the script. This installs all the FlyCapture2 libraries, example code, sample applications, and documentation. Additionally, the script prompts you to configure udev so that devices can be used by a particular user. If you choose to configure devices, the script changes permissions on the nodes by overwriting the default Ubuntu permissions and giving the user full read and write access to the device nodes.
	- Restart your board for the user permissions to take effect.

12. Download and install the FTDI drivers that are required for the Lens Driver Board
	- Go to Box and download libftdi2xx-arm-v7-hf-1.3.6.tgz
	- unzip into the odroid home folder and rename the release folder to libftdi2xx-arm-v7-hf-1.3.6
	- run the following commands in a terminal window
		sudo -s
		cd libftdi2xx-arm-v7-hf-1.3.6/build
		cp libftd2xx.* /usr/local/lib
		chmod 0755 /usr/local/lib/libftd2xx.so.1.3.6
		ln -sf /usr/local/lib/libftd2xx.so.1.3.6 /usr/local/lib/libftd2xx.so
		cd ../examples
		make -B

13.	Configure the OS to bypass the need to request a user login name
# This link tells how to configure the OS to bypass the need to request
# a user login name.  
# http://askubuntu.com/questions/51086/how-do-i-enable-auto-login-in-lightdm
# The solution was to do the following; create a file /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf 
# and add the following contents:
# [SeatDefaults]
# autologin-user=odroid
# autologin-user-timeout=0
# This might only work for lightdm which is the GUI interface for Ubuntu 15.04
	- This file is located in the repository. In a terminal window do the following:
		cd BicycleCamera
		sudo cp lightdm.conf /etc/lightdm
	- Restart the Odroid to test.  You should go directly to the desktop

14. Configure the FTDI Drivers
# This link tells how to setup the LINUX OS to run a script at startup
# This is used to configure the FTDI drivers to stop using the ftdi-sio driver
# in favor of allowing the ftd2xx drivers that are used by the code.
# http://www.upubuntu.com/2015/08/how-to-executerun-bash-script-at-system.html
	- in an explorer window navigate to the /etc folder
	- find the rc.local file and right click to open as administrator
	- enter the odroid passwrod and type the following right before the exit 0 line
		sh /home/odroid/BicycleCamera/ftdi_config.sh
	- save and exit
	- to check plug in the GPS, IMU or Lens Driver and restart the odroid.
	- After restart open a terminal window and type lsmod,  ftdi_sio should not be listed

15. Add VNC Server for remote desktop access. (http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=95&t=15320)
and (http://ubuntuwiki.net/index.php/Xrdp,_installing)
# Run the following:
	- sudo apt-get install vino xrdp
	- vino-preferences
#Set the Vino server to start automatically at login.
	- navigate to: System/Preferences/Startup Applications
	- Use the Add button to create a new entry
		Name = Vino Server
		Command = /usr/lib/vino/vino-server
		Comment = VNC Remote Desktop Server
	
		gsettings set org.gnome.Vino require-encryption false
		
	- edit /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
	
		[xrdp1]
		name=Active Local Login
		lib=libvnc.so
		username=
		password=ask
		ip=127.0.0.1
		port=5900
		
	- Restart the Odroid
		
16. Configure Odroid to shutdown when power button is pressed or voltage is applied to PWRON Pin
	- Go to System->Preferences->Power Management
	- Select the "General" Tab
	- For the "When the power button is pressed" option select Shutdown from the options
	- Press Close
	
17. Configure gpio user group and add odroid to the group and allow non root users to access the 
gpio pins.  (http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=80&t=15000)
	- Navigate to the BicycleCamera folder and in a terminal window enter the following:
		sudo gpio_conf
		

18. Configure the startup script for the program
# don't do this yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# This is how to add the autostart capability in the GUI interface
# 1. Create a .desktop file in /home/odroid/.config/autostart/
# 2. Add the following:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Chameleon_Launch
Comment=Autostart Entry for Chameleon Camera Code
Type=Application
Exec=/home/odroid/BicycleCamera/Camera_Startup.sh
Terminal=true

# Where "Camera_Startup.sh" is the script file that starts the program with
# the required amount of delay.

General Tips and Tricks
# This link shows how to delay the start of a script.
# http://www.upubuntu.com/2011/06/how-to-delay-execution-of-command-on.html

# These links are good refs for preprocessor headings to determine which OS
# is being compiled against.
# https://sourceforge.net/p/predef/wiki/OperatingSystems/

# Basic useful commands for the terminal
# lsmod -> command is used to see what modules are currently running
# uname -r -> command to see what kernel version is running
# lsb_release -r -> command to see what Ubuntu version is installed
# cp -> copy a file from one location to another
# ifconfig -a -> list the available network adapters and their IP addresses
