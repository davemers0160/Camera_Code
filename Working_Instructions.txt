# This link tells how to configure the OS to bypass the need to request
# a user login name.  The solution was to do the following:
# create a file /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and add the following content:
# [SeatDefaults]
# autologin-user=odroid
# autologin-user-timeout=0
# This might only work for lightdm which is the GUI interface for Ubuntu 15.04

# This is how to add the autostart capability in the GUI interface
# 1. Create a .desktop file in /home/odroid/.config/autostart/
# 2. Add the following:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Chameleon Launch
Comment=Autostart Entry for Chameleon Camera
Type=Application
Exec=/home/odroid/BicycleCamera/Camera_Startup.sh
Terminal=false

# Where "Camera_Startup.sh" is the script file that starts the program with
# the required amount of delay.
